## Background

For the past half-year I've been [Dockerizing](https://www.docker.com) most of the development I do for work and personal projects. It's satisfying to be able to version control my dependencies, easily share projects with others, and experiment with packages without polluting my host machine, 

Then I came across Mark O'Connor's [blog post](https://yieldthought.com/post/31857050698/ipad-linode-1-year-later) about setting up a development server that he SSH's into from his iPad. By moving computation-heavy tasks to the cloud, he can work from any machine that has a text editor and an internet connection. His description of the freedoms this gave him inspired me to attempt something similar.

## What I Wanted

Checking Dockerfiles into version control gets you pretty close to this. But 


### Reproducible Environment

NixOS 
- ARM 

### Lightweight Clients

I do
- Mac lock in
