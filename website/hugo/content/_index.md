## Projects

### new_version üì±

[`new_version`](https://pub.dev/packages/new_version) is a small Flutter package I wrote that can check if a new version of your app is in the app store at runtime, and show an update alert to the user.
### Philly Community Wireless üì°

[PCW](https://phillycommunitywireless.org) is building a community-owned wireless mesh network in Philadelphia, similar to the [NYC Mesh](https://www.nycmesh.net) project. I'm working with the tech team to install antennas, setup and monitor the network, and write documentation.

### Self Hosted Services ‚òÅÔ∏è

Unhooking from big tech a bit and running my own tools on a cloud [Linode](https://linode.com) (Philly pride), of which this website is the first. Eventually would like to add mail, git, calendar, kanban. Code lives [here](https://github.com/timtraversy/services).

## Extracurricular

- Guitar: I started learning back in December after reading [Utopia Avenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Avenue) by David Mitchell, and am enjoying the ride. Currently taking lessons from the wickedly talented, Philly's number one guitarist, [Greg Davis](https://gregdavisguitar.com).
- Volleyball: I play a few times a few times a week with [Philadelphia Volleyball](https://opensports.net/PhiladelphiaVolleyball), which holds grass and indoor events for all levels.
